      <h1>Corporate Development</h1>
      <p>
        We started KnuVu as a Strategy and Corporate Development boutique 
        focused on mobile and emerging technologies. Our clients include mobile 
        carriers, handset OEMs, and mobile ecosystem participants ranging from 
        Location Services to Security and Payments, and early stage/startup to 
        large caps. On the Corporate Development front we focus on sub $20MM 
        transactions and work with banking partners on larger transactions.

        <strong>KnuVu Corporate Development Support:</strong> We use our KnuVu as a way to 
        map the ecosystems surrounding a transaction. KnuVu provides visual and 
        quantitative scales to show fit, competitiveness, and provide build-vs-buy 
        analysis for features or qualities of the companies we analyze. We provide 
        KnuVu Corporate Development Support to banks, Acquirers (Buy-Side), and 
        companies looking to be acquired (Sell-Side).

        <strong>KnuVu Buy-Side Corporate Development Services:</strong> KnuVu is a straight-
        forward, simple to use tool for mapping the ecosystem around a potential 
        acquisition and integrating the acquisition into an acquiring company. We 
        work with banks or Acquirers to support investment thesis or as a part of their 
        acquisition process.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>KnuVu Sell-Side Corporate Development Services:</strong> Most of the work we 
        do at KnuVu is working with early stage companies to ascertain whether it is 
        the right time to exit or not. Many companies approach us with an interested 
        party and ask us to ride shotgun with them throughout the process. Our 
        thesis when founding KnuVu was that many early stage companies are 
        innovating and building great features that will accelerate a larger companyâ€™s 
        growth or entry into a segment. We work closely with our clients to optimize 
        value, timing, fit, taxation, integration, and we often work with the acquiring 
        party post-transaction. Here are services we provide:
