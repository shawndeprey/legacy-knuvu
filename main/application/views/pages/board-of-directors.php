      <h1>Team</h1>
      <p>
        We started KnuVu because we found it to be a super useful decision tool that delivered a minimum of 10x
        anticipated benefit in over 300 deployments and we didn’t want to keep the methodology to ourselves. Our
        core values are Altruism, Respect, High-Minded Interaction, and a Passion for Learning and A+ Work.
      </p>
      <p>
        KnuVu currently has a bench of approximately 40 consultants ranging from Partner Level resources to Analysts
        providing a variety of services in several fields including Competitive Strategy, Innovation and Ecosystem
        Mapping and Research.

        <strong>Mike Silva:</strong> Mike Silva is a Mobile & Emerging Technologies Strategy Consultant to startups,
        Carriers, NEPs, and F100s. He is founder and inventor of KnuVu, a heatmapping strategy tool used for Innovation,
        Corporate Development, & Strategy. Mike grew up with the Silicon Valley and after an early career in accounting,
        finance, and IT, earned a Masters of Science in Finance with honors. Mike was the CFO of VPC, an early Speech
        Recognition pioneer where he met Jabra and later went to work with Jabra as VP Strategy. Mike left Jabra to fund
        and lead to Video over IP companies to exits before founding brauning, LLC, a mobile and emerging technologies
        strategy boutique with 20 consultants with offices in NY, SF, SEA, & San Diego whose clients included all the
        Carriers, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Ericsson, Alcatal-Lucent and many mobile upstarts such as Openwave. Mike’s approach
        to strategy has always layered a foundation of Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy with deep domain expertise and
        hands-on front-line experience and execution:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>At VPC he programmed the first drive-through application for a McDonald’s trial;</li>
        <li>
          At Jabra he borrowed technicians’ PCs after hours and trialed 40+ soundboards to invent the first universal
          microphone and audio jack adapter (and was later banned from the lab);
        </li>
        <li>
          Mike was the first to send Video streams to EU and Asia (he also pulled them back) by setting up a global ATM
          network for the Grammys in 1996 which subsequently became the prototype for CDNs;
        </li>
        <li>
          Mike wasn’t just an investor and CEO, he became the “Red Adair” of webcasting and was contracted by Ericsson to
          fly to Iceland with Keiko (Free Willy) to engineer the first video webcast from a plane so concerned students
          across the globe could track his progress.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Mike has always been held up as an innovative strategist and business/corporate development executive but where Mike
        really differentiates from others is in his ability, built by diving in and getting hands-on where needed, to go broader
        and deeper within technological segments to identify opportunities and value creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mike was recruited out of brauning to head up wireless data marketing strategy for AT&T and subsequently to Qpass to spin
        up business development in preparation for its acquisition by Amdocs. Mike helped spin UIEvolution out of Japanese gaming
        giant SquareEnix and funded the transaction by revenue from AT&T and other Carrier deals, growing the company from startup
        to over $30MM. Mike took two years to focus on non-profit, working with NPOs to do more by adopting SaaS technologies and
        running the Mobile Giving Foundation, which allows users to text donations to NPOs. Mike founded KnuVu after leaving the
        Mobile Giving Foundation and has been focused on leveraging KnuVu for strategy and Corporate Development as a sell-side
        consultant, advisor, investor, and operator in emerging technology companies.
