      <h2>Training and Support Overview</h2>
      <p>
        We will provide the appropriate training to get you started. We have a number of website
        materials, however, if you require additional assistance we also provide custom training tailored for your company.
        <br><br>
        We offer unlimited support for our Pro users and Forum or Webmail support for Freemium
        customers. If you have a quick question we can help you with that’s outside of support, we’ll probably just help you out.
        If it requires more than a quick response, we’ll probably provide you with a proposal for support.

        KnuVu is new. It’s a different way of looking at things and while it’s straight forward for us we know it may not be
        for you. There’s a different language we use that cuts across the many different disciplines in your organization,
        from Finance to Development to Supply Chain. We host Webinars regularly and have YouTube Channel, Guides, FAQ, a
        Knowledge Base and a Forum.
      </p>

        If you require more than what is offered online or want to scale up and educate your team we also provide onsite
        training. Here is a list of Training Services we offer:
